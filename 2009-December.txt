 Dear Friend, <http://www.ebuppies.com>

 eBuppies.com (www.ebuppies.com <http://www.ebuppies.com/signup.php>
) is a new online dating site that is dedicated to providing singles
from all over with the opportunity to connect with other buppy singles
in their local area or anywhere of their choice. 

 More and more buppy singles are going online to connect with others
because going out week after week to nightclubs and bars can be
tiresome, as well as expensive. eBuppies.com makes dating easy by
hosting hundreds of profiles of different singles looking for love.
Buppies can join on a monthly basis for less than they would probably
pay for one night at a nightclub or bar.

 Buppies who are looking for love, romance or just friendship now have
a unique resource that can help them discover their future soul mate:
eBuppies.com. 

 Although high technology drives eBuppies.com, the online dating site
is simple and easy for buppies to navigate. Buppies can register,
browse, search and contact other singles
<http://www.ebuppies.com/signup.php>
at no charge. There is also no charge for buppies to upload a photo
with their profile. A control panel enables buppies to customize
preferences based on their individual requirements. The control panel
also blocks undesired contacts for buppies' convenience.

 The pricing for membership is quite cost effective especially for the
average buppy. By January 31 2010 visitors can sign up for 1 Month and
get 30 Days extra membership exclusively through our THIRTYPLUS
<http://www.ebuppies.com/signup.php>
 promo code.
